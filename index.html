        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi. My name is Nastya Herasymova <br />
          My birthday is 01.04.2001 <br />
          Live in Ukraine Lviv <br />
          I classify myself as an <br />
          artist, animator, designer
        </p>

            width="370"
            alt="My self-portrait"

        </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Hold on</h2>
        <p>Let me introduce myself in my usual style</p>
      </div>
      <section>
        <h2>Howdy!</h2>
      </section>
      <p>As I said already,</p>
      <p>
        My name is Nastya <br />
        but my nickname is lemangocat. <br />
        My friends call me <br />
        lemon or mango
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an optimistic person <br />
        who loves art and games in general. <br />
        I'm not very good at talking <br />
        but I respect other people's opinions, <br />
        so it's easy to communicate with me. <br />
        I'm not afraid of criticism and I like to <br />
        learn something new, gradually <br />
        improving my skills. <br />
        Mostly always with headphones <br />
        I feel most comfortable with them <br />
        And don’t worry I can hear you clearly with <br />
        them <br />
        Favorite game genre <br />
        shooter, platformer, horror, action. <br />
        <p>
       </p> Ok as you now can imagine what person I am, <br>
         let's see what I can offer for you
      </p>
